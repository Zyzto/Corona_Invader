# Level System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a 5-level progression system with a final boss fight for Corona Invader.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Level Configuration (LEVEL_CONFIG)
- **6 total levels**: 5 normal levels + 1 boss level
- Each level progressively increases difficulty:
  - Level 1: 3x8 enemies (ðŸ¤¢ only), bullet speed 4, enemy speed 1.5
  - Level 2: 4x9 enemies (ðŸ¤¢, ðŸ˜·), bullet speed 5, enemy speed 1.8
  - Level 3: 4x10 enemies (all types), bullet speed 6, enemy speed 2.0
  - Level 4: 5x10 enemies (ðŸ˜·, ðŸ˜ˆ), bullet speed 7, enemy speed 2.2
  - Level 5: 5x11 enemies (ðŸ˜ˆ only), bullet speed 8, enemy speed 2.5
  - Level 6: Boss fight, bullet speed 9

### 2. Boss Class (ðŸ‘¹ Corona King)
- **Health System**: 100 HP, takes 2 damage per hit (50 hits to defeat)
- **3 Attack Phases**:
  - Phase 1 (100-67% HP): Triple shot pattern
  - Phase 2 (66-34% HP): Tracking bullets + spawns 2 minions every 5s
  - Phase 3 (33-0% HP): Wall patterns + spawns 3 minions every 3s
- **Movement**: Side-to-side across the screen
- **Visual**: Large 64px sprite with red glow effect
- **Health Bar**: Displayed at top of screen showing current/max HP

### 3. Dynamic Speed System
- Removed time-based speed increases
- Bullet and enemy speeds now based on current level configuration
- Slow powerup applies 0.5x multiplier to enemy bullets and movement

### 4. Level Progression
- **Auto-advance**: Levels automatically progress when all enemies are defeated
- **Transition Messages**:
  - Level 2: "Infection Spreads"
  - Level 3: "Pandemic Mode"
  - Level 4: "Critical Condition"
  - Level 5: "Final Defense"
  - Level 6: "BOSS FIGHT: Corona King!"
- **2.5 second delay** between levels to show transition message

### 5. Powerup System Enhancements
- **Level-based drop rates**:
  - Levels 1-2: 15% chance
  - Levels 3-4: 20% chance
  - Level 5: 25% chance
  - Boss minions: 100% chance (guaranteed drops)
- All powerups maintain 10-second duration (except shield)

### 6. Victory Conditions
- Normal levels: Clear all enemies
- Boss level: Defeat boss (reduce health to 0)
- Final victory message: "YOU SAVED THE WORLD!"
- Victory only triggers after completing level 6

### 7. Game Reset Improvements
- Resets to level 1 on game restart
- Properly clears boss state and level tracking
- Loads level 1 with correct configuration

## Technical Changes

### Modified Functions
- `getCurrentBulletSpeeds()`: Now uses level config instead of time-based calculation
- `updateEnemyMovement()`: Uses level-specific enemy speed
- `spawnPowerup()`: Level-based drop chance logic
- `handleEnemyHit()`: Calls `checkLevelComplete()` after enemy death
- `endGame()`: Updated victory message
- `resetGame()`: Loads level 1 instead of creating enemies directly
- Game initialization: Calls `loadLevel(1)` instead of `createEnemies()`

### New Functions
- `createEnemiesForLevel(config)`: Creates enemies based on level configuration
- `loadLevel(levelNum)`: Loads specific level, handles boss/normal levels
- `showLevelTransition(levelNum)`: Displays level transition messages
- `advanceLevel()`: Progresses to next level with delay
- `checkLevelComplete()`: Checks win condition for current level

### New Classes
- `Boss`: Complete boss implementation with health, phases, attacks, and minions

### Game Loop Integration
- Boss update, draw, shooting, and minion spawning
- Boss collision detection with player bullets
- Score award (1000 points) for boss defeat

## Balance Notes
- Starting bullet speed reduced from 6 to 4 for level 1 (as requested)
- Boss requires 50 direct hits to defeat
- Boss becomes more aggressive as health decreases
- Minions only spawn in boss phases 2 and 3
- All existing powerup mechanics preserved

## Files Modified
- `game.js` (~400 lines added/modified)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Verify level 1 starts with slower enemy bullets
2. Test level progression through all 5 levels
3. Confirm boss fight mechanics (3 phases, minions, health bar)
4. Validate powerup drop rates increase with level
5. Ensure victory triggers only after boss defeat
6. Test game reset returns to level 1

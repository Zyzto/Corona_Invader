Build A Game ! 
This project is about building a game in **HTML/CSS/JS**
In a span of 4 days *(for me it was 2 cause you know laziness)

# The Game

## Corona Invader

This is Space Invader with some styling to resemble the current Corona virus

### Specification

The game was built using Canvas a HTML5 way of drawing 2D vectors,
which can be used like real canvas draw from **Y0** to **Y5** and **X0** to **X5** and with certain thickness and that will draw **L** and if you set a repeating function you create new image each frame.

### Controllers
You can control the character by moving the mouse sideways and clicking the left click to shoot
